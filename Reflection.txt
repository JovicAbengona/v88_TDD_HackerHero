TDD vs Non-TDD

    While I was reading about TDD, my main thought was "It's like OOP. Bad for small projects, great for big projects".
And it's true becuase TDD is very time consuming and you won't feel its benefits on small projects because there aren't much to test in the first place.
But it's more beneficial for bigger projects because of TDD's scalability.

    With TDD, you will already know if your planned approach will actually work and because of this you can design better code. You'll be able to come up
with better algorithm and your code will be more readable too. It will greatly improve your attention to detail as well. 

    All in all, I think TDD and writing tests for our code is really important because it will greatly lessen the time we need to debug our code
because TDD makes debugging a lot faster.
